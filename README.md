# POTPEncryption
Implementation of message encryption using the pseudo-random one time pad scheme in several forms.
I first implemented the encryption and decryption using a command-line C++ program.
I then turned the program into a web application using JS/React.
Finally, I created a Windows Destop App with the same functionality.
